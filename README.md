# CSS Modules

Your task on this branch is to style our weather application with CSS Modules. Take the styles in `public/global.css`, comment all of them out and get cracking!

Note that there is a few more folders on this branch than on the others. (`config/`, `scripts/`) That's because we had to eject `create-react-app` to add support for CSS modules to it. **Ignore the extra folders and focus on the task at hand**.

As a reminder, to see the finished app visit https://styling-workshop.now.sh. This is what the finished app looks like (and should look like after converting it to CSS modules):
