# React in Flip Flops

Welcome, we're happy to have you here with us in Las Palmas! 🌴☀️🏄

Before the workshop starts please make sure you can get this repository and run it locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/mxstbr/riff.git
cd riff
npm install
npm start
```

A browser window should open at `localhost:3000` (if not, try going to that URL manually) and you should see a welcome message. If so, you're set up and ready to go! 

Make sure you have [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) and the latest stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. If any of these commands fail, please reinstall the relevant binary.
