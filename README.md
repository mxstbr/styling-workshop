# Lab #4: Styling

Your task in this lab is to style our weather application in three different ways:

- Inline styles
- CSS Modules
- `styled-components`

We've pre-filled out the solution of the last lab (so you don't have to do that again) and styled it with a global CSS file. (`src/global.css`) You have to move those styles to the new way and make sure it looks as close to the original as possible.

This lab is based on three branches (`4-styling-inline-styles`, `4-styling-css-modules`, `4-styling-styled-components`) that have the same starting point. Take the styles in `src/global.css`, comment all of them out and get cracking!

This is what the finished app looks like (and should look like after converting it to a different library):

There are no unit tests verifying the correct solution—if your app looks the same with the moved styles that's it! (note that a 1:1 move might, in some cases, not be possible)
